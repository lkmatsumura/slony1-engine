* Slony-I Release Notes
** 2.1.0 (beta 3)

-Fix for bug #159, distclean deletes the slony_logshipper flex/bison generated files.

- Bug #204 :: Additional fixes for failover to a non-direct subscriber
              where circular paths in sl_subscribe could happen

- Bug #214 :: Add slonikconfdump.sh back into tools

- Bug #218 :: Obtain a lock on sl_config_lock before calling
              storePath_int

- Bug 219 :: Default to PostgreSQL 8.4 support if the version of PG is newer
             than what slony recognizes.

- Bug #220 :: Fix issue where changing the provider of an existing
              subscriber passed parameters in the wrong order to the
              stored procedure.
- Bug #223 :: Clear out the last saved event number when uninstalling
              a node.  This prevents slonik from waiting for a node it just
              uninstalled.
*** Some items without bug numbers:

- Fixed slonik memory corruption when it tries to get the last known
  event_id from a node that doesn't yet have slony installed.

- Bug 219 Default to PostgreSQL 8.4 support if the version of PG is newer than
          what slony recognizes.

- Fix threading issue in monitor_thread where slon_init can be called
  without the mutex being locked. This function was written to assume
  the mutex lock exists.  
  
** 2.1.0 (beta 2)

- Bug #204 :: Upgrade from 2.0.x fails under PostgreSQL 8.3, fixing
              issues with failover and non-direct subscribers

- Bug #206 :: Do not perform an accidental rollback in a try block

- Bug #211 :: Modify the altperl tools so they don't enclose statements
             that wait for events inside of a 'try' block.

** 2.1.0 (beta 1)

*** Some items without bug numbers:
  - Introduced tests using the clustertest framework, consisting of two
    sets of tests:
    - clustertest/regression - port of the old tests in the tests directory
    - clustertest/disorder - new simulated order entry system with a fair bit of concurrency

  - Configure and Makefile cleanups and improvements, including
    - Configure looks in common locations for some of the DocBook
      tooling, so it is less likely to require manual intervention on
      some common distributions
    - Pick up Groff automagically
    - Script to do virtually all the work documented in the [[http://slony.info/documentation/2.0/releasechecklist.html][Release Checklist]]
  - Documentation updates
    - Reorganized sections
    - Trend towards having version-specific documentation, rather than
      trying to have it document all versions at once
  - Git changes
    - Numerous .gitignore files set up to ignore generated files
  - Add a resetSession function that will reset the session state
    cached in the C stored functions.
